                  Orlando AH aims to provide websites that are accessible to everyone, including individuals with 
                  disabilities. The website is designed to be accessible to people with disabilities by meeting the 
                  World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA.

                <p>
                  Wherever possible, we use live text instead of graphics to reduce the download time of pages and increase your control.
                  No information is exclusively conveyed using color. This doesn’t mean that colors are not used to organize information; instead it means there are also other, non-color dependent ways of doing this.
                  We have attempted specifically to comply with Section 508 referring to website accessibility standards.
